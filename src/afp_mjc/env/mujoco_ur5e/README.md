# mujoco-model-of-ur5e-with-robotiq-2f-85

This repo has a mujoco model of ur5e with robotiq 2f 85 mounted on. These two models are adapted from [mujoco_menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie) and combined here. Two sensors are added namely force/torque and gripper's finger tip.
